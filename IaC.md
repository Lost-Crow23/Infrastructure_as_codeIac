<h1>Infrastructure as code</h1>

<h3>What is Iac?</h3>

- Infrastructure as code, refers to the practice of managing and provisioning IT infrastructure, through machine readable definition, rather than manually
configuring systems. 
- Treating infrastructure, config as code, and storing them in version controls like git.
- YAML, JSON AND HCL are used as languages or formatsm which describes the state
- reduces errors and inconsistencies 
- supports CI/CD, enabling rapid deployment
- higher scalability and agility as infra configs can be replicated and modified to meet changes
- Terraform, Ansible and chef are used as frameworks to implement and manage Iac.

<h3>What are the benefits?</h3>

- Allows more efficient and reliable management as the code is auto tested, reviewed and delpoyed.
- Reduces errors and inconsistencies 
- Version control systems like git enabling collaboration, change tracking and easy rollback.
- Consistency 
- Speed
- Scalability
- Reusability 
- Testing
- Cost-effectiveness

<h3>What are use cases and how it is used in the industry?</h3>

- Cloud services, like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) 
use IaC to enable customers to provision infrastructure resources using machine-readable configuration files.
- DevOps teams use IaC to automate infrastructure provisioning and deployment, and to integrate infrastructure 
testing into their continuous delivery pipelines.

- Infrastructure provisioning: IaC tools like Terraform, Ansible, and CloudFormation enable organizations to quickly and easily 
provision infrastructure resources, including servers, networks, and storage.

- Compliance and security: IaC enables organizations to enforce security policies and configurations across all infrastructure resources, 
ensuring compliance with industry regulations and best practices.

- Disaster recovery IaC enables organizations to quickly and easily recover from disasters or system failures by automating the provisioning 
of backup infrastructure resources.

<h3>What is Configuration management?</h3>

- Configuration management involves defining the desired state of infrastructure resources, and then automatically configuring those resources 
to match that state. Tools, such as Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and SaltStack, are used to automate the configuration of infrastructure resources.
- Enables organizations to manage infrastructure at scale, and to achieve greater consistency, efficiency, and agility.

<h3>What is Ansible?</h3>

- Ansible is an open-source configuration management, deployment, and orchestration tool that allows IT teams to automate infrastructure provisioning and 
configuration tasks. It is used for managing servers, network devices, cloud infrastructure, and applications.

<h3>what are the Benefits?</h3>

- Scalability: Ansible is designed to work at scale and can manage thousands of hosts with ease.
- Community: Ansible has a large and active community, which provides support, documentation, and a large number of pre-built modules and playbooks.
- Agentless Architecture: Ansible uses a push-based approach and does not require any agents or additional software to be installed on the target hosts, making it easy to deploy and manage.
